## 🧪 Testing the Integration

### 1. Test Calendar Access
```
!calendar-status
```
Expected output:
- ✅ Gmail Service: Connected
- ✅ Gmail Work Calendar: Active
- ✅ Personal Calendar Service: Connected
- ✅ Weather Service: Connected
- 📊 Integration Health: 🟢 All systems operational

### 2. Test Direct Work Calendar
```
!work-calendar today
!work-calendar week
```
Should display work events from your Gmail calendar with meeting categorization.

### 3. Test Enhanced Briefing
```
!briefing
```
Should include:
- Weather update for Toronto
- Work calendar events (direct from Gmail)
- Work priorities analysis
- Personal calendar events
- Cross-calendar coordination
- Meeting preparation summary

### 4. Test Work Analysis
```
!work-analysis priorities
!work-analysis conflicts
!meeting-prep today
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Gmail Service: ❌ Disconnected"
- Check GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON is valid JSON (use JSON validator)
- Verify Gmail API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Ensure service account has proper project permissions

### "Work calendar not accessible"
- Verify GMAIL_WORK_CALENDAR_ID (try 'primary' for main Gmail calendar)
- Check Gmail calendar sharing with service account email
- Ensure service account email has "See all event details" permission
- Calendar sharing can take 5-10 minutes to activate

### "No work events found" (but you have events)
- Check timezone settings (should auto-detect Toronto)
- Verify calendar sharing is active and saved
- Try different GMAIL_WORK_CALENDAR_ID values
- Use `!calendar-status` for diagnostic information

### Permission Issues
- Service account email must be shared on the correct calendar
- Try removing and re-adding the service account email to calendar sharing
- Ensure you're sharing your work calendar (not personal)
